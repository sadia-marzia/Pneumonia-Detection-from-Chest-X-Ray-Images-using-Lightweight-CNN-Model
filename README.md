# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-using-Lightweight-CNN-Model
This repository presents a computationally efficient lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. The model is specifically designed for resource-constrained environments, where access to high-end hardware and advanced diagnostic tools is limited.
